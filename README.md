# Rent Splitter

####This is my final project for Front End Web Development course, General Assembly school, my first small step learning coding: a html, css and javascript project.

The goal of this project was to create a Javascript calculator that allows a group of friends to split the rent in the most proportional way when they are going to share a house.

Working on this project a learnt a lot about javascript, css and responsive design using media queries; After my Makers Academy experience, I recently added Jasmine's tests and Sass on top, in order to refactor a bit the css.
